# logtojson

This app uses git log on a specified git project and transforms the output to a .json file.

Feel free to modify it however you think would be best for you.
If you ever need to modify the json structure please pay attention to the 'prettyFormat' constant at the beginning of the file. Add whatever information you need from git log there. Then it's just a matter of adjusting the 'processLog' function to also add your parameter to the object that shall be saved as .json.

for any further help please e-mail me petersonvgama@gmail.com
